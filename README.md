CheckoutFi-PHP
==============

This is a better (in my opinion) implementation of the PHP example provided by Checkout.fi.

Main goal of this project is to create highly usable and well documented PHP interface for Checkout.fi payments.

Features
--------

It currently supports the basic payment processing.

Future features
---------------

- Support for payment status queries from checkout.fi servers.
- Support for the legacy checkout.fi payment processing method (only if really needed)
- More perhaps?
